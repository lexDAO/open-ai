 All right, welcome everyone and thank you all for coming. Welcome friends. We're really happy to bring this event to you. We're really happy for the speakers we have. I'm very excited about them. I've interacted with a number of them across the last few years of my journey in crypto law. We have the great pleasure of having a great sponsor, a number of sponsors in... Yeah, a huge thank you to all of our sponsors which are Metacartel, Brown, Rudneck, Unlock and LexDow of course. Yeah and also thanks to Gitcoin for allowing us to use this space gratis and we also thank you all for respecting that. I know it was kind of annoying to have to get in between 1 and 1.30. The shoe's off but it is a neighborhood area and they offer us the venue for free. We're very happy to have it and it's actually very nice to have kind of a close knit close group here. So thank you again and I'll go ahead if you want to introduce the two speakers or I'm happy to. Yeah absolutely. So Nick's going to kick off a intro, the state of the dows. We have Victor Roette from MCV and Hydra and Sky Mine from Metacartel and DXDow. You guys can hop up and while you're sitting down I'll let everybody know our schedule was more or less set up into two 30-minute panels, a 15-minute break and then two more 30-minute panels and then another break. The breaks are at 2.30 for a coffee break and 3.45. All right welcome guys. Victor, Sky. So we have you up here just to talk a little bit about what the state of the dow is, maybe a little brief history of how it's come to where it is but really what's interesting you in the dow space, somewhat in the dow legal space but really just in the expansive use of dows. Sure I'll start. So yeah I think it's a great time for dows but I think we're generally in a space where we're kind of past the naive era of dows and I think there's a number of kind of sacrifices that have been made based on the kind of earliest conception of what dows could be where you'd have this monolithic smart contract architecture that would operate on homo economicus to achieve these goals of utopian design without any kind of change and you'd be allowed to have you know anon token holders govern it and all the emergent governance would come together and you know there are numerous, numerous, numerous examples of how that pattern failed and needed to be redesigned and so you see a lot of kind of either new dows or reconfigured dows that are trying to narrow and I think bring us back to things that are a little bit more traditional as far as how organizations work so you see the move towards you know automatic delegation inside of how ENS worked where you kind of get everybody to sign on to a consensus kind of you know series of constitutional prospects and then give power to delegates looking at how things like optimism are using the badge holders for retroactive public goods funding these are all sort of returning back to more you know sources of leadership centralization and so I think that's that's one of the things that's happening and it's kind of good because the dows that are surviving are making changes that move away from sort of idealism to much more practical capability and they're getting there slowly and surely and the other thing that's there that I think makes this kind of difficult to speak about is that much like crypto in general the different verticals and the styles of the subject matters in crypto and then the types of dows and what they're attempting to do have really differentiated the point that there is not really generalizably great best practices that work across different types of dows so a protocol dow that's supposed to exist in perpetuity has an incredibly different set of incentives and incredibly different set of challenges that lead to much different patterns than an investment dow that is you know set to wind up after deploying you know a certain number of capital that was accumulated and so in my experience which is on the investment dow community first community led investment dows that are much smaller sub done bars number known members that are docs to each other you know there's a lot of things that we feel like we've improved that model with the sort of culture that's built around that the legal stack the operational stack and yet whenever I talk to people and get really deep into a conversation about dows and then I realize they really care about you know protocol dow much of my advice is absolutely you know not salient there so the differentiation of the different types of dows I think is something that now requires specialization inside of each kind of model rather than a dow expert in general so that's my take thank you thanks yeah Victor and I have both been dows probably for four or five years now and you will hear in the last probably year like some people will say dows you know didn't work dows are dying like the dows have gone away we've been through this cycle as Victor mentioned and I still think dows are here like dows are managing the most money they've probably ever managed there's big protocol dows but the way ICOs like showed the of crowdfunding capital or money for like new ideas which kind of got rug pulled and things dows allow like crowdfunding coordination and that can be like three-person dows with a multi sig around a small micro idea or that can be giant protocol dows in the DeFi space that are owning world-changing protocols and also massive treasuries and and tokens and things and there's different types yeah and then from a yeah I like the fact the experimentation across all these different types of dows is happening there's dows with no legal entities like some of these giant protocol dows basically can't have legal entities like you know swap token dow that owns a protocol and then there are smaller ones that will we in yeah we've had some upennos over the last couple summers about legal discussions and dows and there's ones that have single legal entities there's ones that have multiple legal entities there's ones in all different jurisdictions I'm pretty excited about like seeing how the Colorado cooperative ones play out there's maybe five or six projects that are all using the Colorado cooperative and we're here in Colorado and it has this framework for making a Dow using that framework we haven't yet seen so I was I just met a new one coinage is using the same mechanism which is a media property and there's collab land there's opolis and there's sporked out actually and I'm excited to see things like the continuation of these dows so like actually maybe some of these dows end up making money and start paying out to the members of their cooperative and that's still yet untested so I think in Colorado it's okay but I'm interested to see how like the US government might look at that when when this cooperative starts paying out their token holders and so we have all this different experimentation we have things like this shirt is for a yeeter is a new product and it basically took the cool things about ICO crowdfunding and then combined it with the power of a Dow and put it together so you can actually ape into a Dow throw money on idea but the people that get that money can't rug pull you and just take the money and disappear because the money goes into a Dow and you become part of that Dow and so that's a not a crazy idea it's a new idea it's now very easy to do you can just go use that product and so that's an example of taking the things we've learned over the over the last few years and like making the solution that we actually need and then the other cool thing most of the Dows that I think we've been in are not liquid token governance now so there's a lot of Dows where liquid token governance is the control of the whole Dow but that really means that with a lot of money you can just go take over a Dow and so it became more popular when Vitalik wrote the paper on sold-bound tokens but a lot of our Dows share-based Dows and Malik Dows DX Dow is using Dowstacks reputation system and now you have NFT badge holders with optimism stuff so because we're iterating on what types of Dows we have because plain liquid token governance Dows there's a lot of problems with them and and so other ways and pockets here XE who's putting the two things together I think allowing your liquid token capital providers plus the people that are contributing and building the project all to govern a Dow together is like the answer we don't have the perfect system for it yet but I think it's all gonna move in that direction yeah thank you and kind of working off what you guys were talking about as you see Dows proliferating and diversifying and going into new areas restructuring where do you see those best practices develop are there branches or categories what kind of Dow service organizations or where can Dows reach out to service or find resources to then work on those best practices together or get to a place where it's a little less of a dark forest yeah I think there are some very interesting things that are kind of adjacent you know support and service related either companies or Dows themselves that are emerging there's one that we work with with Hydra Ventures called thing three these are essentially crypto-pilled professionals legal accountant other types of sort of service providers that decided they wanted to have upside in the in the companies they were advising and so they sort of perform work on a multi-year contract basis in exchange for a share of the of the Dows equity and so the notion of bringing in people from different sort of professions and and bring them in is very exciting one you know and figuring out what the right balance between you know paying people sort of out of pocket versus you know when you make a exchange or a equity deal with folks is something that people are I think looking at different experimental forms for and so yeah the service Dow model is exciting I think that the yeah sorry I think I lost my train of thought there's only that's it just that yeah and related to so that thing three which he mentioned is this this Dow or service Dow that can service many different Dows and more and more the big especially the big protocol Dows like like Arbitrum and Optimism and things you're seeing companies so rather than individual contributors you're seeing small sets of companies whether that's for operations whether that's for running grants programs whether that's for a dev shop that can build things that the Dow needs you're seeing more small groups of people basically self-organizing either as a Dow or a small little company to provide things that Dow's actually need and either getting paid you know often through ecosystem grants but now there's the whole retroactive we call it retroactive public goods funding but I think it's more like network goods funding like if you're contributing value to the Optimism ecosystem you can actually earn quite a bit of money I mean they just gave out in December and now it's being streamed right now 130 million dollars to people that in the last year have been contributing value to their ecosystem which most of its public goods but not all of it and so the fact that that exists now people are building frameworks and tools to allow investors to support teams that are going to build into that space that are servicing Dow's and then there's just more reason for you to be like I don't I know I don't have funding right now but I'm just gonna create value for this ecosystem and I hope I hope I get paid and if you actually create value you will get paid and so that's a new dynamic that's really cool. Yeah and Lex Dow got plenty of OP RPGF funding and we're very thankful for that and I think it is it is going to a public good and we're very much in support of that very thankful. Oh yeah just to add to that that so the the retroactive unlike pre-permission grants I guess retroactive funding is effectively revenue for like past value already created and so you could theoretically just take that money and pay everyone that helped make that happen and that will happen part partially but I think we'll see very quickly this 120 million dollars a lot of that money will get reinvested back into the ecosystem which provided it and then that's gonna boost that ecosystem and they have even more money to create a cycle and optimism is leading that but I think Gitcoin and ENS and Arbitrum and many other ecosystem Dows will probably assume that approach or at least as part of their programs as well. Yeah and somewhat similar to the last question but maybe in a little different light you know as I saw it a lot of liquid token Dows and venture backed Dows through liquid token governance provided a lot of leadership in the area of ICO and following as to what Dows can be what Dows can provide how to make Dows is that leadership coming from elsewhere now are there beacons of hope of that leadership is it in you know OP RPGF is it fractal or is it individual Dow leaders and how do you support that? So I think one of the things that's nice is that people learn for each other really quickly in the space and so I think that sometimes that comes from you know somebody being successful in a Dow raising their profile they're able to use you know communication platforms and panels and things to teach other people and what they know I do think that it's quite different from that ICO phase of things where you had you know just massive amounts of money and massive amounts of participants and it was a much more anarchical thing to sort of marshal and they had to have kind of a centralized thing whereas I think more sustainable Dows are able to kind of like sense their communities sense where the sort of borders and cultural values are coming from and then sort of construct leadership that creates legitimacy within that organization so I think it's a little bit of a different process where it doesn't kind of come from a almost like a pitch deck founder mindset of creating the whole thing from the start and people just sign up but that it's more participatory and I think that one of the things that's really valuable and useful now is not just the leadership models and the best practices but also just the tooling stack has gotten mature to the point where everybody is basically comfortable with things like a no-sys safe they're familiar with the interface they've been battle tested for however many years with however many billions of dollars that are there you know things like snapshot the modular aspect of how you can pick up and use these tools and that lots and lots of people in the community are familiar with them so that even if you know a new group of folks want to form a Dow they could very quickly learn a good recommendation so you don't have to spend so many cycles thinking about oh how are we actually gonna hold our money in this thing and how do we process transactions and how do we you know conduct votes that feel fair and we're using custom new tools that are either monolithic and hard to understand they don't do what we want so I think that really takes a lot of the like administrative debt out of it or the administrative overhead and so the the Dows are able to focus I think the ones that are doing well on really just focusing on like what feels legitimate and what is the culture that they're trying to build and they don't spend as much time I think like fetishizing the code and you know spending all this time on some sort of optimized you know deployed smart contract as as the savior for a Dow. Yeah in terms of tool one thing a few things I learned over the last four years is these are the three things that I came away with from four years of Dow work you need a very clear mission that a bunch of people care about and want to be a part of that without that like your Dow's not gonna do anything and without a CEO you have this collective that makes the final the big decisions collectives are not great at making hard decisions they kind of like make the average stuff so Dows needed to get they Dows have been really bad at and they're getting better at delegation so you delegate decision-making where hats protocol and other things are allowing that to happen easier where roles clear delegations but once you have delegation in order to make quicker decisions with like access power and stuff you need the other most important thing is evaluation so delegation without evaluations pointless and so now we have other tools like ones where we can better evaluate as a collective and coordinate and there's like naming a bunch of tools but these are basically addressing delegation and evaluation you put those two things together and then a collective and then it gets the brainpower of everyone rather than one CEO if you put that all together we think that some of those Dows will outperform centralized entities I think. One final question and then I'll open it up for a few questions from the audience we'll talk a little bit about business orgs but also about AI and network states and the upcoming panels is there a very bright future in any of those to you or is there any specific part of the the future of Dows that you have anything you're enthusiastic about? Yeah I mean I'd say like the business org case is very fruitful I think the notion is that you're trying to essentially accentuate and extend human collaboration right and Dows don't just have to be obviously for people that are one in one particular space and crypto and this kind of thing and so you know I'm always hesitant to think that we're ready to share this with other people yet I think that we're still in a very fruitful discovery period and we're making useful mistakes and innovating off of those but the notion of extending other existing business forms do allow a lot of upsides not only just with the you know reduction in the kinds of costs of Treasury management and worries about embezzlement and this kind of thing that smart contracts can help eradicate that and increase trust and transparency but that you also have the notion of just like asynchronous collaboration and the patterns that Dows are learning about when you're working with people from all around the world that are awake at different times and you know the balance between sync and async collaboration is something that I think is gonna is gonna help businesses in general going forward rather than the sort of we're gonna choose where to locate ourselves and we're gonna you know bring in the people we're all gonna be in the same office and awake working at the same time so I think that that's got a lot of prospect I mean AI's is one that I don't think I have a hot take that's anything beyond what I'm sure the panels got ahead but it's obviously going to be transformative it's going to give Dows much more insight into themselves but it also I think risks undermining the I think the social glue that happens right if there's too much deference to some other collaborative sense making or synthesis of things and then a recommendation to let's say do this investment or follow this particular protocol design suggestion you know you have you risk that essentially people are losing the the social consensus and the and the thing that keeps the community caring about each other and it's just sort of an outsourcing and I no longer have to care about this and that's I think one thing that we'll have to think about whether that's gonna make Dows more effective if they lose the sort of social components to them yeah rather than AI I think it's easier to talk about it like a decentralized science example these set makes a ton of sense for Dows like crowdfund a few guys in a laboratory to have some money to test an early early idea that was being unfunded and untested it was only being funded by either institution like a university or government I guess but allow people to crowdfund that actually own the IP of that initial idea share it open with everyone so it's all worked in the open but you it's documented who created that idea let people build upon it in an open kind of open source type environment in the science world and then have some exit to either it's hard to produce it so eventually it gets sold to like a big pharmaceutical company to produce or whatever but that's like a perfect example of bringing Dow coordination and money to a real world vertical that was basically impossible four years ago yeah and maybe retro public goods funding for science any questions from the audience I'm curious we limited the Bitcoin ETF today people started working on that ten years ago right when the market cap of crypto was maybe 10% what is it there was this vision to create the same it was going to take a long time well I'm curious from each of you really simply what what's your distillation what's your simplest conception of a vision of Dows ten years from now and to the extent you can say that in a way that somebody who's not I don't know crypto native or technically minded how would you explain it to them and you know within the context of the question I think yeah they'll be they'll be invisible for the most part and people will be able to essentially do things together in collaborative ways that they don't even realize how this is happening under the hood it's simply like communities are forming communities are dissipating using a sort of stack that's been proven out to think about the culture that works to keep them together there's obviously going to be very big business cases of this I mean there's obviously things you could think about with like governmental you know starting with municipalities and going up and thinking about Dows that are based around people in a geographic location those are going to be much more powerful those are going to be much more successful in ten years and you can imagine essentially like a city you know I think you might start with something like HOA organizations and then eventually small like network state you know governance will sort of start to prove this out I think probably by ten years that stuff will be in pretty good shape I think it's going to be even longer before you actually like harvest and or take over existing sovereigns as far as their their governance and figuring out how to have stakeholders use a Dow to accomplish the things that representative democracy you know mechanisms are currently doing because there'll you know there'll be a big fight about that for a long time so I think in 10 years we're starting to like have those fights seriously about like how do you transform governance into something that actually does more directly reflect the interests of the stakeholders there that's going to be the probably the biggest thing yeah the the Bitcoin ETF was in one place under one regulator crypto grew over that period of time because you can't because no one could no one in the world could stop it Dows can't are natively web3 they can't really be stopped and so that will just continue how the Dows interact with the regulated worlds in the different jurisdictions will be need to be figured out but you're not going to be able to stop people from coordinating yeah so I think it will yeah progress very fast actually yeah do you have any questions can I ask one from up here I kind of like this the scarcest resource is is like human attention and time and uh you know there's so many different ways to spend your time these days and I've found I've seen your Dallas getting kind of hijacked by the few people that you know have a time energy that is spent how do you deal with that system that you want to be decentralized have a lot of buy-in how do you crack that I've seen different ideas like optimistic voting yeah I agree with you that that everyone wants to contribute to way more things that they can and so a lot of people do get we said they get burnt out in that world because they're overdoing themselves we need more people and more resources coming in and then allowing for people to have slightly more focus you mean you can float about lots of different dows or a lot of people will contribute to one or a few dows that's a that's that the reason the problem for that is there's so much opportunity and we don't have enough people this is still like a tiny little space we need more people be able to commit full time to working I think in the decentralized world yeah yeah we think about this a lot um right now that the answer I have for it is have much smaller dows and really be vigilant on essentially having that have a positive experience every time that doubt does anything together because essentially I mentioned earlier the notion of homo economic is this idea that human beings are motivated exclusively by um you know rewards and and risks and that they will conduct themselves in a way that the incentives are are drawing them and that does not work in crypto it's too distracting people will lose interest so you need to find something and essentially culture and community are the two components there that seem like they're nice to haves and they sometimes come across as a little bit woo woo but they really are the the necessary component to have sustainability inside of a dow so that means that anytime somebody comes back into the dow it's legible to them so they can see what's happening so you need transparency and it hasn't it allows them to to get the answers they need and so the the leaders inside these dows need to be thinking quite a bit about maintaining that sense of of legibility legitimacy and they also need to really be thinking about like how do we make this work for for the lazy you know dow contributor how do we not sort of turn into this like specialist of high priests that are the ones that think about this stuff all day and when you come back to a dow six months later it's an entirely different set of concerns and there's new language they're using so you know i don't know the answer to this exactly other than if you start small and you think about using the the sub done bars number you know patterns that we have in our own built-up evolutionary psychology that's a really good clue about how people stay motivated they care about other people they care about communities that they feel a sense of meaning and you know understanding it and so doing that for a larger dow protocol dow that goes on for a long time is a very very uh difficult challenge it's going to take some time to sort of put this together but i think i think you got to think about these this notion of culture and community as as primary there rather than just mechanism design and i think with that we'll wrap this one up thank you very much victor thank you sky really appreciate it
