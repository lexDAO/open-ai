  "title": "The State of DAOs: Insights from LexDAO's Panel Discussion",
  "date": "2023",
  "author": "LexDAO",
  "content": "
In a recent panel discussion hosted by LexDAO in collaboration with MetaCartel and Unlock Protocol, experts gathered to discuss the evolving landscape of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). The session, held at a venue provided by Gitcoin, brought together thought leaders Victor Roette from MCV and Hydra, and Sky Mine from MetaCartel and DXDao, to share their insights on the current state and future of DAOs.

The panelists reflected on the journey of DAOs from their naive beginnings to their current state, where practicality is beginning to trump idealism. They noted that DAOs are moving away from the utopian vision of anonymous token holders governing through monolithic smart contract architectures. Instead, there is a shift towards more traditional organizational structures, such as delegated consensus and leadership centralization, as seen in ENS and Optimism's use of badge holders for retroactive public goods funding.

The differentiation of DAO types was highlighted as a significant development, with protocol DAOs and investment DAOs facing distinct challenges and requiring specialized expertise. The panelists shared their experiences with community-led investment DAOs, emphasizing the importance of culture and legal frameworks in their success.

Despite some claims that DAOs are fading, the panelists argued that DAOs are still very much alive, managing more funds than ever and exploring new forms of coordination and crowdfunding. They discussed the various legal structures DAOs are adopting, from those without legal entities to those utilizing frameworks like the Colorado cooperative law.

Service DAOs emerged as a key topic, with organizations like Thing3 providing professional services to DAOs in exchange for equity. This model is seen as a promising way to integrate diverse professional expertise into the DAO ecosystem.

The panelists also touched on the importance of clear missions, delegation, and evaluation in DAOs. They suggested that DAOs with these elements could potentially outperform centralized entities. The discussion concluded with a look at the future of DAOs, envisioning them as invisible frameworks that enhance human collaboration, potentially transforming governance at various levels, from local to global.

The session underscored the dynamic nature of DAOs and the ongoing experimentation and learning within the space. As DAOs continue to evolve, they are poised to significantly impact not just the crypto world but also traditional business and governance models.
